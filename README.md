# Fresh-Code
Fresh-code is a tool to create a drill-down heat treemap to help programmers visualize "freshness" of their codebase. A small video of how it works https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xglTM2Q-gs&feature=youtu.be

# How to Use
- Make sure you have `git` installeed
- run `npm run analyze <REPO_CLONE_LINK>`
- `REPO_CLONE_LINK` is a github url for a repo to which you have access, you should be able to run `git clone <REPO_CLONE_LINK>` to retrieve the repo, if not this is not a valid input.

# Use-Case
Using the graph generated a programmer can easily identify legacy parts of the codebase, information which is vital in migrating codebases from one framework/dependency to another
