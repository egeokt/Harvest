# Harvest
Harvest is a tool to create a drill-down heat treemap to help programmers visualize "freshness" of their codebase. A short video of how it works https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xglTM2Q-gs&feature=youtu.be

# How to Use
- Install git and npm.
- Run `npm install`.
- Run `npm run analyze <GIT_REPO_CLONE_LINK>`.
- Then run `npm start`.

# Use-Case
Identify the legacy parts of the codebase and user contribution by navigating in the generated graph. This information can be useful in many cases such as debugging and/or migrating codebases from one framework to another.
